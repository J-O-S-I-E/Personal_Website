                        <p>
                            I am an afro-Trinidadian university student based in Brooklyn, NY.
                            I enjoy participating in activities that can benefit my community.
                            During my years participating in extracurricular activities, I was able to interact with like-minded
                            individuals with different goals and interests in the field of STEM and preforming arts.
                            <br><br>
                            At NYIT, I am also the Vice President of the First-Generation Students Club. Our mission is
                            to
                            recognize, empower, and celebrate first-generation students when they join the NYIT community and
                            progress through their academic program.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, I am participating in the Undergraduate Research and Entrepreneurship Program with a
                            group of students from the College of Engineering and Computing Sciences at NYIT. Our mission is to
                            research sustainability in the scope of either architecture or energy consumption and apply
                            technology
                            to determine the best possible solution for urban communities in New York.
