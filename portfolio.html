                    <p><br>I am passionate about Software Development and gradually building a strong expertise in
                        coding. I
                        have worked on various projects, including Mobile App Development using Thunkable to creating
                        programs
                        using C. I believe in continuous learning and strive to improve my skills every day.</p>

            <h2>Mobile App Development</h2>
            <div id=text>
                <p><br>I enrolled in the Intro to Mobile App Development, MIC Institute of Technology where I learned
                    about Graphical User Interfaces using a drag and drop mobile application website called Thunkable. I
                    also learned about UX design to create appealing interfaces and also practice backend development. 
                    I had a clear understanding of using different approaches for developing a Mobile App, the
                    creation of a Web App using Thunkable, I understood components, layout, navigation, handing events
                    using blocks, accessing sensor data, handling data with an API.
                    With my newly developed skills, I participated in a national and regional hackaton within the span
                    of 1 year.

            <h2>Java Projects</h2>
            <div id=text>
                <p><br>I began uing Java when I enrolled in the CSCI 185 during the NYIT fall 2023 semester. Despite no
                    prior experience using Java in the CSCI 125 course, I was confident that with my background
                    algorithem design and coding, I would be able to successfully complete this course.</p>

            <h2>C Projects</h2>
            <div id=text>
                <p><br>
                    I have been using C for 2 years to create Menu Driven projects for my Caribbean Advanced Proficiency
                    Examination (CAPE) student based assessments. These assessments required groups of students to using
                    the research, design, develop and test a feasible solution with its functional and non-functional
                    requirement based on a clearly defined problem statement. During the 2 year CAPE Computer Science
                    program, my group
                    members and I implemented 2 large scaled projects using the Agile Methodology. I served as a project
                    manager to ensure each member's task is completed while being the lead programmer for each project.

            <h2>Database Management and Analysis</h2>
            <p><br>
                For Unit 2 of Infomration Technology, students were required to apply the skilled developed during our
                year of learning to create a project either a website using HTML and CSS or a database management system
                using SQL and MC Access. My group members and I decided to create a datamanagement system based on a
                relevent issue affect our community. I received an introduction to Information Management and Database
                management system tools during my final year of my CAPE Information Technology program. I learned about
                SQL, the construction and normailation of databases and the organisation of files and databases.
